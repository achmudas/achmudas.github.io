  I am always trying to learn new technologies that I would be able to use them in job-related and my personal
  projects. That's why I'm always working on some projects to learn those technologies as in my opinion the best way
  to learn something is just by doing.

  Another goal of mine is to create passive income by creating things which would be useful.`;
