I was thinking how I could make that posts would contain some format. The simplest choice probably is to use markdown. Decided to try library https://jfcere.github.io/ngx-markdown. From the first look it does the work, setup is also straightforward.

By the way, thinking not to use backend for website and just store posts as part of frontend in one way or another.
