Nothing new, still working on `Portfolio` page. CSS can be complicated when you want to make things nice and the way you want :)

Changed `Card`'s on `hover` behaviour - instead of changing color of `Card` - increasing thickness of box shadow. Looks much more pleasant for eyes.

Also working on buttons styling (Github and Link).
