Fixed CSS styling in `About Me` page. The issue was related with `<markdown>` tag and how Angular applies styling for child components.

Also started to work on `Portfolio` page. First thing looking for good examples how to implement styling. 
It seems that best approach is to use grid and put clickable cards.
