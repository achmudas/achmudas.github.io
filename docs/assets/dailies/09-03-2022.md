So I rewrote `About Me` page from markdown to Angular HTML component. Reasoning is simple: I need to make `Portfolio` page and it will be hard to make appealing using only markdown. 

So it's better to make only blog posts as markdown and other pages as usual Angular components. In that case some kind of consistency will be present.
